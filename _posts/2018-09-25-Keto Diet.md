summary:    I tried a keto diet and tracked my results. Turns out it's hard to maintain.

I tend to be very sceptical of diet fads. It's partly because [nutrition studies are really hard to get right](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/you-cant-trust-what-you-read-about-nutrition/), because there are powerful lobby groups and private interests pumping misinformation into the public consciousness, and because my personal experience has been that simple things like avoiding alcohol and fast food, cooking my own meals, and avoiding compulsive snacking/overeating are plenty sufficient for getting into shape.

But, a few weeks ago, a friend recommended trying the keto diet, and it was the fourth time I'd heard about this in the span of a few months. I've been trying to push myself to get to a higher level in rock climbing after feeling like I've plateaud over the past year, and feel like getting a bit leaner would help. I did a little research and found that the scientific consensus was [relatively positive](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/healthy-weight/diet-reviews/ketogenic-diet/).

On top of this, my normal everyday diet is already pretty close to keto: I eat a lot of meat, eggs, fish, and cheese, and almost never eat rice or pasta. I'm someone who leaves my bowl of rice untouched at an Asian restaurant. Plus I cook most of my own meals already, so I figured this would be pretty easy (spoiler alert: I was wrong).

So, I decided to do an experiment: one month of keto. Here's my full log:

#### Day 1:
Eggs, liver pate, and sauteed mushrooms for breakfast. Green oolong tea w/ginseng
1.5 hours at the gym. My routine looks like this:
* ran 4km at a rate of 10.5km/hr with 1-minute 16km/hr sprints every 5th minute
* weight lifting with 4 sets of reps per exercise at increasing weight. e.g. fly press with 15 reps @ 60lbs, 10 reps @ 150lbs, 8 reps @ 190lbs, 5 reps @ 230 lbs[1](#fn1)
* core workout w/planking, a ton of crunches w/medecine ball, lower back hyperextensions, leg lifts
* I sometimes do squat jumps and/or lunges, but my legs are (almost comically) genetically disproportionally stronger than my upper body, so I often just skip that
Stopped at the grocery store to get some cold cuts, cashews, and sunflower seeds for snacking.
Salmon and broccoli (a lot of it) for dinner.
**I weigh 189 lbs pre-workout, 184 post**

#### Day 2:
Cheese omlette for breakfast @ 10am. Iced ceylon tea
1.5 hours of rock climbing, followed by a protein shake.
Protein shake & tuna salad for lunch.
Made a giant pot of chili con carne (no beans) to eat a few more meals of.
Stopped eating around 6pm because I read online that 16-hour fasts could help ketogenesis kick in.

#### Day 3:
Full english breakfast. White tea w/jasmine
no gym, rest day
Southwest-ish chicken salad for lunch
Decided to try cooking indian food; made butter chicken for dinner (it came out tasty but no rice or naan made it a little heavy)
*By now, I was starting to feel some effect from the change in diet. I felt low-energy and my pee started smelling strong*

#### Day 4:
Red pepper & sausage omlette for breakfast. Green oolong tea w/ginseng
1.5 hours at the gym
Chili for lunch
Egg salad for dinner (without bread this wasn't great)

#### Day 5:
Too busy for breakfast today. White tea
1.5 hrs rock climbing
Chili for lunch
Made a cauliflower cheese soup with bacon for dinner
Rock climbing in the evening

#### Day 6:
I was getting really sick of eggs for breakfast, so I toasted some cashews and mixed in some sausage with red peppers and onions. It was pretty good but heavy for breakfast. Lapsang Souchong (smoked black tea) w/lime
no gym, rest day
Salmon with avocado/vinnegar/garlic puree for lunch
Leftover cauliflower cheese soup for dinner
*I'm getting random headaches when I'm hungry. My pee smells really strong and my body odours are a little funky. I never knew I could crave mac and cheese so badly. When I look at a fresh loaf of bread my mouth waters. This diet is way harder than I thought.*

#### Day 7:
Chili for breakfast (this is the last of it, thank god...). Green oolong tea w/ginseng
1.5 hours at the gym
Protein shake
Chicken bacon and avocado salad for dinner
**I weigh 183 lbs post-workout**

#### Day 8:
Had some friends over for a BBQ. Was snacking until late afternoon when the feasting began
Piles of pulled pork, ribs, and smoked salmon for lunch/dinner. Mmmmmmmm
I had a few beers and they hit me noticeably harder than usual. And they were so delicious.

#### Day 9:
Too busy for breakfast today. White tea
1.5 hours of rock climbing
Protein shake & leftover ribs from the bbq for lunch
Balsamic & olive oil-marinated portobello mushrooms stuffed with gruyere and sausage for dinner
*I'm not really feeling tired any more, but I'm really, really sick of eating close to zero carbohydrates. I'm starting to dream of pizza and sourdough bread. My body is starting to feel different, though: I suddenly feel like I weigh less when I'm rock climbing, even though I haven't actually lost any weight.*

#### Day 9:
Full english breakfast. Iced chinese oolong tea
1.5 hrs gym
Just some coldcuts, cashews & nuts for lunch, was too busy w/work to cook
Made a massive pile of pork tenderloin w/a dill-teriaki sauce for dinner

#### Day 10:
Avocado, liver pate, scrambled eggs for breakfast--pretty gross; needed something crunchy or at least not so soft. Iced green tea w/jasmine
45 mins of rock climbing
Leftover pork tenderloin for lunch
Roasted cauliflower & herb-crusted chicken thighs for dinner.
*The negatives side-effects of ketosis seem gone except that my pee and body odours are still kind of weird. Oh, except for an increasing hatred of all keto-friendly foods. I'm working really hard to cook a good variety of foods but I can't really seem to mask the fact that my body just wants carbohydrates.*

#### Day 11:
The last of leftover pork tenderloin for breakfast. Pu-erh tea
rest day
Cobb salad for lunch
Taco salad without taco shells for dinner.

#### Day 12:
Bacon & cheese omlette for breakfast. Green oolong tea w/ginseng
1.5 hrs gym
Salmon steak for lunch
Ribeye steak w/mushroom and onion sour cream & soy sauce for dinner
**I weigh 195 lbs with clothes on. Wait, what?**

#### Day 13:
Full english breakfast. Ceylon tea
1.5 hrs rock climbing
Protein shake
Big southwest-style chicken salad with bacon for dinner
*I weigh myself again just to be sure.* **Yep, 196 lbs.** *What is going on? I don't understand. I look leaner and feel stronger but I've gained a significant amount of weight. I'm sure I've been on a calorie defecit given that I feel vaguely hungry almost every day. I can't explain this. I'm also getting really, really sick of the lack of food options.*

#### Day 14:
Tuna salad for breakfast. White tea
1.5 hrs gym
Protein shake
Bacon cheeseburger without a bun for dinner
**189 lbs post-workout.** *Looks like I can confirm I've gained ~6 lbs. While I don't feel like I've gained weight, the measurements don't lie. This is crazy, and given how unpleasant this diet is, and the fact that I'm going on a trip with friends this weekend, I'm calling it quits.*

So concluded my experiment.

It's beeen about 10 days since I stopped keto-ing. There was one weekend of very heavy eating followed by a week of normal eating (healthy, home-cooked foods mostly), and a bit of a drop in training (it's been 3 days this past week instead of ~5). I seem to have dropped back down to ~186 post-workout, but I am definitely looking leaner, and have gotten stronger. It's not clear whether how much my diet impacted my strength gains, but it's clear it didn't help me lose weight. The fact that I gained weight still doesn't make much sense to me.

In the end, I don't think I would recommend a keto diet to anyone. I'm not sure what I learned about its effect on my body, but I definitely learned that the side-effects were unpleasant. I just love food too much.


<a name="fn1">1</a> I learned about doing an extra low-weight set to start exercises and really like it: it warms up my muscles and feels like I strain them less: I feel like it lowers my injury risks and might help with building strength.
