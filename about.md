I'm interested in AI, cryptocurrencies, poker/chess/go, rock climbing, cooking, and social issues.

co-founder of [monadical](https://monadical.com/), building [oddslingers poker](https://oddslingers.com)

***

**Some of my Projects**
* [oddslingers](https://oddslingers.com/about) -- a new poker platform that integrates video streaming into the business model
* [redux-time](https://github.com/Monadical-SAS/redux-time) -- for typical functional-reactive web apps, state is a function of (previous_state, event). This library adds the concept of (previous_state, event, **time**), so that animations become natural instead of hacky "transitions".
* [netviz](http://cowpig.github.io/netviz/viz.html)-- A tool to visualize neural network training. Change the architecture, dataset, and neuron weights. Go back in time. Mess around with it and see how it affects learning.
* [storycoin](https://github.com/cowpig/blockchain) -- a playful blockchain built in rust/js in which nodes use hashpower to vote on the next word for distributed story-telling.
* [eth sandbox](https://github.com/cowpig/eth) -- A repo with everything set up to start playing around on the Ethereum testnet.
